This orbit is a special case which updates a 3rd party dependecny that is packed by a feature implicitly and it's not a orbit bundle.

Since this bundle is not an orbit it does not follow the stanrds for naming and versioing. And we can't change it as it's not possible to change the JAR name.

This orbit is added as a special case though it does not follow wso2 standrads for naming, versinoing, etc.
